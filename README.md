## Tools used

Important: the 3d model needs to be as lighter as you can in order to get great render speeds, so voxel its a great option for light 3d files.

### 3D Model
- MagicaVoxel: Build your own [voxel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel) and save it as `.obj`
- Blender: Import your `.obj` model and then export to `.glb`

### Stack
- Next.js
- Chakra UI
- Three.js
